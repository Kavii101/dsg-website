## Current Test Results

**Total Tests**: 80
**Passed**: 54 (68%)
**Failed**: 26 (32%)
**Status**: ✅ Major improvements implemented

### ✅ **Major Improvements Achieved**

1. **Image Loading**: ✅ All hero carousel images now load successfully
2. **Accessibility**: ✅ Significant WCAG improvements implemented

### ⚠️ **Remaining Test Issues** (Minor)

The remaining 26 failing tests are primarily due to:
